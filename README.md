# Quant Commodities Lab ðŸš€

This is my personal Quant Commodities Learning Lab â€” an open project to explore and build applied quantitative models for physical commodities trading, derivatives, market microstructure, and risk management.

My goal is to:
- Sharpen my mathematical and modeling skills for finance & trading
- Build a portfolio of practical, well-documented projects
- Learn advanced probability, statistics, and quant finance techniques
- Understand market behavior in metals, energy, and other commodities

## ðŸ“š Planned Projects

### âœ… Project 1 â€” Volatility Modeling of Metals Markets
- Model historical volatility (GARCH, EWMA)
- Compare to implied volatility (if available)
- Forecast volatility and explore trading implications

### ðŸš§ Project 2 â€” Term Structure Modeling
- Scrape / pull futures curves (LME, COMEX, ICE)
- Analyze contango/backwardation dynamics
- Predict curve shifts and arbitrage opportunities

### ðŸš§ Project 3 â€” Derivatives Pricing
- Implement Black-Scholes and stochastic volatility models
- Apply to options on metals futures
- Study volatility surfaces and risk-neutral dynamics

### ðŸš§ Project 4 â€” Physical Flow Modeling
- Model shipping, inventory, and storage optimization
- Simulate PnL of physical trading under price/volatility scenarios

### ðŸš§ Project 5 â€” Market Microstructure Modeling
- Model order book dynamics
- Study liquidity costs and price impact
- Explore execution strategies in liquid commodities

## ðŸš€ Why this lab?

I am transitioning toward a career in **physical commodity trading** (metals focus), and I want to deeply understand:
- The math and physics of markets
- How modern quant techniques apply to real-world trading
- The intersection of engineering modeling and financial markets
