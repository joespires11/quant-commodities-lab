# Project 1 â€” Volatility Modeling of Metals Markets ðŸš€

This project models historical volatility in metals futures markets (eg. LME, COMEX) using:
- GARCH models
- EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average)
- Rolling window statistics

**Goals:**
âœ… Understand how volatility behaves in physical commodities  
âœ… Build forecasting models for volatility  
âœ… Compare historical vs implied volatility  
âœ… Explore volatility dynamics around market events  

**Skills used:**
- Time series modeling (ARIMA, GARCH)
- Statistical learning
- Visualization
- Financial interpretation of volatility models

---

## Data sources

- LME metals futures (copper, aluminium, zinc, nickel, lead, tin)
- COMEX metals futures (gold, silver)

---

## Progress
